# üìù Context

While a person/user with no significant sensory, physical, or cognitive limitations will be able to use the accessibility cards just fine, a different-abled person (e.g., colour-blind autistic or dyslexic bilingual person) will not.


# üéØ Goal

Choose one card from the Accessibility Cards set and redesign it in such a way that it accommodates for the needs of a different-abled person/user. The redesign can take a physical or digital format.

1) Identify the persona card you chose to redesign
    - Middle school student with ADHD and dyslexia
2) Describe the specific abilities of the person/use
    - no motor disability
    - ADHD and dyslexia
    - difficulty reading and concentrating
    - moving content can be too distracting
3) Specify how you made sure that your redesign accommodates for the needs of the person/user you defined
    - change font (OpenDyslexic/ CenturyGothic)
    - change contrast
    - available in 5 different languages (en, es, fr, pt, zh-CHS)
    - semantic HTML
    - scores 9.8/10 in [AccessMonitor](https://accessmonitor.acessibilidade.gov.pt/)
    - text-to-speech feature for each language
